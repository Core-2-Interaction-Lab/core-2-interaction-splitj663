I am nowhere near where I hoped I'd be as an adult, but I still have things I never thought I'd have when I was 17. A wife, a condo I just bought, and my first kid on his way.

These days when I see anything Nostalgic I get a feeling of absolute sorrow in my stomach. But at the same time, the feeling is so addictive, that's why I'm here. The past needs to eventually be left behind, but in times like this, it's just so hard to do that. I will never forget my history, especially with this game.\n",

If you’re happy with your life and are living to it’s fullest it can sound depressing and hopeless, but if you are in a position where you feel hopeless or detached from your life it can sound soothing, and can put you back to a moment you felt safe, even if that moment was brief. It all changes depending on perspective and that’s what I love about this piece\n\nEdit: I didn't think some post I made 2 years ago when I had just recently got myself out of a toxic friend group would get so popular.

About a month ago today, I ended an abusive friendship, one of the hardest things I've had to do. I knew this person my whole life, but they didn't love me, even if I loved them. So when I listen to this song and think about that time, it helps me to remind myself it takes time to heal. Healing from trauma, loss, depression, anxiety, suicidal thoughts, abusive, and life. Not all scars go away, some stay forever. I know I'm not the only one. I hope one day when I look upon my scars that I do not look on them with only somberness but reminds me of how I've grown, and what I got myself out of.",

During this period, I would just stay up at night and listen to this and feel a variety of emotions, from fear, to uncomfortable, to sadness and would just let it all out. Exactly seven days later, I was pulled out of class and sent home early and had the opportunity to stay with her for two more hours before she was inevitably euthanized and freed from the chains holding her to this mortal plane. Callie, we miss you dearly and those eight years were full of many moments, both sad and happy. May death do us part but I do hope we can meet again one day, perhaps in a happier situation.\n\nEdit: Thank you all for your kind words. I'm back here as I reminisce on the past year in the final hour before 2023, hard to believe she won't be here for this year. I'll miss her and relistening to this hurts like hell, but she's in a better place now, running around without a care in the world. It's been 2 months as of 1/2/2023 which is honestly hard to believe.\n\nUpdate: 3/31/2023. It's really crazy that in just about a month, it'll have been half a year. I'm off to High School very soon and that has it's ups and downs but I've recently kept on relistening to this as I've done my yearly replay of UNDERTALE. It gives me a strange feeling, not of great sadness nor fear or uncomfortableness like I once felt. It just feels weird, like as if I've finally moved on from that. It still does make me not happy but not to the extent it did in the past. I feel off and numb when listening to this."

It was one of the greatest feeling achievements of my life. I'll forever love this song and all of it's beautiful music that had been stuck in my head since the beginning🖤",

I just started to play the original super Mario galaxy game again because lately I've been feeling really depressed. I feel like I'm just growing up too fast and I'll never get that time back...\n\nSorry i wrote this while crying so sorry if it sounds dramatic\n",
        "comment2": "My love for space comes from this game. 15 years ago, I was a little boy playing Super Mario Galaxy in his basement. 15 years later, I am a studying Astrophysicist tracking the movement and behaviors of Supermassive Black Holes at the center of galaxies. And while I study, this playlist is on loop the entire time, reminding me of my undying passion for the cosmos and the mysteries that lie above us.",
        "comment3": "To me, this song is more than just a video game OST. Tomorrow morning, I'll be selling my first car. I learned how to drive manual with it. It got me through the pandemic, college, a relationship and 3 jobs. I drove it the entirety of the east coast. I can't think of a more fitting song to play going to the dealership.",

I remember the wii feeling so futuristic and different. We got the wii with this for Christmas that year and it was one of my favorite memories. My parents are no longer together and my family is pretty spread apart but I loved those times and I’ll definitely always remember them",

        "comment12": "When I was little I used to play Mario games. And years later, I watch my son play it. There is a feeling of nostalgia, but also of fullness. I watch him play, and I have the impression of becoming the little girl that I am no longer. Mario is truly timeless. I am sure that in a few years I would watch my grandchildren play it again.",
        "comment13": "I remember how magical it was to play this game when I was a kid. I remember not stressing or feeling pain, the only worry I had was making it to school on time. Getting home and playing Mario galaxy in my sisters room is such a strong feeling for me, reminds me of the nights when I would steal her iPod to listen to music and fall asleep. Being more mature and grown has its benefits but living without stress and depression was the best thing ever. If you are young  please enjoy the time you have before you are working a job and dealing with unsurpassable situations and circumstances.",
        "comment14": "Let me tell you a short little tale. Flash back to around elementary school. I'm on break for a while and visit my grandma, sleeping in the living room with my brother. We wake up, the sun shining through the window. Excited to play the game more. That single memory has kept me going for a while.",
        "comment15": "I don’t want to get emotional but Mario Galaxy really takes me back to times where I wouldn’t worry so much. I’m writing this as someone who’s currently 17 (turning 18 in December) and I understand that I still have my whole life ahead of me.. but sometimes I wish I could just go back to those times. Just for a day or two, to re-experience those happy childhood moments where all I had to worry about was if I was staying up too late while playing, and even then, I never cared.. I’m sorry for the upsetting comment but I just wanted to express how much this game means to me."

When I first heard this song in 08, I pictured stills of happy memories I had with him and started to ball my eyes out. \n\nIts been 20 years since I lost that friendhship, and still, whenever I hear the first few notes, I remember, and I cry. The longing to go back, to tell everyone back then that I loved them and goodbye one last time still haunts me, and I;ve accepted that it probably always will. Tell the ppl in your life how you feel, before your last chance to to do passes you by.",

        "comment5": "Everyone here is sad, and nostalgic, and its fine to look back at these times with nostalgia, but try to look at the positives in your life now, and how the past times shaped you to be who you are, and be thankful we grew up on things like this, maybe even play some Pokémon. Spread the positivity :)",

        "comment14": "I am writing this on the eve of my 20th birthday. Today is my last day as a teenager. I feel like listening to this is a bittersweet farewell to my childhood. I am very happy that I grew up on this game. Road trips to Disney, and getting to play on the way home from school, or sneaking my dsi underneath my pillow so my grandma, or parents did not catch me. Great times :) I’m glad to read through this comment section to find that there’s many of you who shared similar experiences with me. Much love to you all from Miami, Florida.",

You know it feels like I am not progressing in life, I am not good at anything specific, the college I am going to is not that good and my grades arent helping the fact that I want to transfer, I feel like my parents are disappointed at me everytime especially my dad, I just sometimes think I am just wasting space when i see other people with the same chances I have get so much higher in life and I am here addicted to p**n and not getting anything done, haven't kissed a girl or anything, I just feel like a failure. But you know I still have a lot of time in this earth  I am going to change so I am proud when I look at this and see the dark hole I have claimed out of and I guess I will just write this rn so I can remember later \"Being in the bottom is not bad, but staying there is unacceptable\".\n\nFile 1\nsave 1\nSaturday - 10/8/2022 2:56 pm\nJorge / mangayuki700\n\nSorry for putting this comment in this video because its so peaceful compared to my comment.\nAlso ff7 is one of my favorite games and it always helps me to get up when I am feeling down.",
